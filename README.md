# DP4+ App
## A tool for DP4+, MM-DP4+ and Custom DP4+ probability calculation

### Description
DP4+ App is an integrated software capable of performing already parameterized DP4+ and MM-DP4+ calculations. Furthermore, Custom-DP4+ calculations can be performed, where any level of theory required can be parameterized. Its friendly graphical interface allows easy manipulation of multiple Gaussian calculations and automatic information processing to perform the probabilistic calculus.

### Installation Requirements 
**DP4+ App** needs python 3.8 or later to work. Find it in <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

The programme can be installed in two ways:
* using the operating system console with the command: 
> `pip install dp4plus-app` 

* running the following script [DP4+App_Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RosarioCCLab/DP4plus-App/main/dp4plus-installer.py) (Save the code with right click on the website screen -> 'save as').

### Execute DP4+ App

If the programme is installed via command line, it can be excuted in the same consoloe using: 
> `dp4plus`

In case [DP4+App_Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RosarioCCLab/DP4plus-App/main/dp4plus-installer.py) is used, the programme can be run also by command line or by doble click in the shortcut that has been created on your desktop.

If the executable is missing or not created yet, the `dp4plus.py` shortcut can generated using command line: 
> 'dp4plus-exe`
